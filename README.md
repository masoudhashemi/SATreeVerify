This folder include examples for end-to-end propositional formulation of RandomForest Classifiers. 

There are three main experiments included in this folder:

1. RandomForest encoding
2. CNF conversion and SAT Solver benchmarking (z3 with SMT2 v. MapleCMS with CNF encoding)
3. Finding a lower bound: this is mostly base on adding extra conditions and heuristics to reduce the search space.
